    Company: Metablify LLC
    URL: "https://www.danforthcenter.org/news/big-ideas-3-0/"
    Position: Data and pipeline engineering
    Location: Creve Coeur, Missouri
    Start: April 2024
    End: Present
    Tasks:
      - As a Computational Biologist in a small team of four within a non-profit academic research institution, I collaborated with a Principal Investigator, a Biophysicist, and a Biostatistician to overhaul our computational infrastructure. My responsibility was to enhance the speed, cost-efficiency, and accessibility of our analytical platform for untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).
      - 98\% reduction in data processing time :- I optimized our untargeted metabolomics pipeline using Python, Dask, and PBS cluster on a Linux environment. This enabled faster iterations and advanced our novel scientific research in developing algorithms that provide higher quality signal out of untargeted LC-MS.
      - 90\% reduction in capital costs :- By optimizing code execution, I cut computational costs from hundreds of dollars to approximately \$20 per run, freeing resources for further research and innovation.
      - Scalability and modernization :- I refactored data structures and infrastructure, migrating the platform from a limited local cluster to an AWS-based Slurm cluster, supporting larger datasets and future growth. I also modernized the codebase, making it modular, maintainable, and accessible to non-programmers.
      - Enhanced collaboration and knowledge transfer :- I introduced Jupyter notebooks, enabling non-programmers to perform complex analyses and accelerating experimental workflows. I provided ongoing support and training, ensuring a smooth transition to the new system.
      - Improved performance and reliability :- I updated software architecture, replacing deprecated libraries and restoring critical functionalities.
      - Our team was able to meet key milestones on schedule, advancing our pipeline in groundbreaking research and innovation in metabolomics. Specifically, our work focused on developing algorithms that provide higher quality signals out of untargeted LC-MS, a critical area of research with significant implications for the field.

    Position: Comutational Biology
    Location: Creve Coeur, Missouri
    Start: May 2023
    End: Present
    Tasks:
      - As a computational biologist, I combine expertise in biology, chemistry, and programming to tackle complex research challenges. By integrating analytical chemistry, biochemistry, genetics, and software development, I deliver impactful scientific results.
      - Developed a Novel Computational Pipeline:- Created a pipeline for an innovative LC-MS algorithm, extracting meaningful data from over 60,000 mass features. This involved detecting metabolic signals through precise analysis of chemical mass differences, generating valuable feedback for upstream algorithms.
      - Streamlined Analytical Chemistry Challenges:- Applied programming and data interpretation skills to provide biologically relevant insights, addressing complex analytical chemistry challenges.
      - Reconstructed a Critical Multi-Omics Study:- Revitalized a 2019 study by addressing missing data, limited documentation, and disorganized code, salvaging valuable research.
      - Established an Industry Benchmark:- Contributed to the development of an industry-recognizable benchmark showcasing our team's tools, enabling effective storytelling and advertising of our capabilities.
      - Transformed a Fragmented Codebase:- Refactored a bash codebase into a versatile, user-friendly R package, extending the tool's functionality from three to all species, and solving issues with legacy code and outdated libraries. The tool is now publicly available and accessible to non-programming biologists.
      - Revived and Modernized Legacy Data:- Restored 16-year-old ionomics data from a deprecated system, verifying data integrity and modernizing the system for public access. This prevented data loss and opened new potential funding opportunities.
      - Fostered Collaboration and Technical Support:- Provided regular assistance to colleagues with programming, HPC, and Linux, helping them navigate technical challenges and promoting a collaborative environment.
