    Position: Data and pipeline engineering
    Location: Creve Coeur, Missouri
    Start: April 2024
    End: Present
    Tasks:
      - As a Computational Biologist in a small team of four within a non-profit academic research institution, I collaborated with a Principal Investigator, a Biophysicist, and a Biostatistician to overhaul our computational infrastructure. My responsibility was to enhance the speed, cost-efficiency, and accessibility of our analytical platform for untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).
      - 98\% reduction in data processing time :- I optimized our untargeted metabolomics pipeline using Python, Dask, and PBS cluster on a Linux environment. This enabled faster iterations and advanced our novel scientific research in developing algorithms that provide higher quality signal out of untargeted LC-MS.
      - 90\% reduction in capital costs :- By optimizing code execution, I cut computational costs from hundreds of dollars to approximately \$20 per run, freeing resources for further research and innovation.
      - Scalability and modernization :- I refactored data structures and infrastructure, migrating the platform from a limited local cluster to an AWS-based Slurm cluster, supporting larger datasets and future growth. I also modernized the codebase, making it modular, maintainable, and accessible to non-programmers.
      - Enhanced collaboration and knowledge transfer :- I introduced Jupyter notebooks, enabling non-programmers to perform complex analyses and accelerating experimental workflows. I provided ongoing support and training, ensuring a smooth transition to the new system.
      - Improved performance and reliability :- I updated software architecture, replacing deprecated libraries and restoring critical functionalities.
      - Our team was able to meet key milestones on schedule, advancing our pipeline in groundbreaking research and innovation in metabolomics. Specifically, our work focused on developing algorithms that provide higher quality signals out of untargeted LC-MS, a critical area of research with significant implications for the field.
